Repository Contents:

    1) README.md: (This file) A brief description of the repository and its contents

    2) LinkedList.py: A doubly linked list ADT implemented in python

    3) ListTest.py: A python file which tests the functionality of the LinkedList.py ADT

    4) funcdesc.txt: A plaintext file outlining the functionality of each function defined in the List Class in LinkedList.py

    5) musicqueue.py A client file using the List ADT to create a mock a queue like what music streaming services have
Description:

    I wrote both LinkedList.py and ListTest.py as practice in writing python as well as examples to use for future reference. I may update this repository to include other data structures in python as well as other descriptions of them.

    4/12/23: Added musicqueue.py as an example of using the linkedlist to make a queue for music

How to run musicqueue.py:

    In a directory containing both LinkedList.py and musicqueue.py, run:

    $ python3 musicqueue.py
