Descriptions of all functions within LinkedList.py

ACCESS FUNCTIONS:
getFront():
returns data of the front Node, or none if the list is empty

getBack():
returns data of the back Node, or none if the list is empty

getCursor():
returns data of the cursor Node, or None if cursor is undefined

getNext():
returns the data of the node after the cursor, or None if node after cursor is undefined

getPrev():
returns the data of the node before the cursor, or None if node after the cursor is undefined

Index():
returns the current cursor position. If the cursor is undefined, returns -1

Length():
returns the length of the list

Equals(List L):
Compares this list to L, returns true if equal, false otherwise


MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS:
append():
Appends a Node to the back of the list

prepend():
Appends a Node to the front of the list

insertAfter(x):
If cursor is defined, inserts a new Node with data = x immediately after the cursor
Else does nothing

insertBefore():
If cursor is defined, inserts a new Node with data = x immediately before the cursor
Else does nothing

delete():
If cursor is defined, cursor is deleted and becomes undefined
If cursor is not defined, or length is 0, does nothing

deleteFront():
If front is defined and not cursor, front is deleted
If front is defined and is cursor, front is deleted and cursor becomes undefined
Then, if length is 0: Front, Back and Cursor become undefined

deleteBack():
If back is defined and not cursor, back is deleted
If back is defined and is cursor, back is deleted and cursor becomes undefined
Then, if length is 0: Front, Back and Cursor become undefined

clear():
Puts the list back to an empty state.

moveFront():
If length > 0 moves the cursor to the front of the list
Else does nothing

moveBack():
If length > 0 moves the cursor to the back of the list
Else does nothing

moveNext():
If cursor is defined and not at back, cursor moves forward one position
If cursor is defined and at back, cursor becomes undefined
If cursor is undefined does nothing

movePrev():
If cursor is defined and not at front, cursor moves backward one positoon
If cursor is defined and at front, cursor becomes undefined
If cursor is undefined does nothing

setCursor(x):
If cursor is defined, sets data to X
If cursor is not defined, does nothing


OTHER FUNCTIONS:
__str__(self):
string representation of List

__repr__(self):
string representation of list
(just calls __str__)
